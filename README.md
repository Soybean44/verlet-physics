# Verlet Integration Physics
This is a toy repo to mess with creating my own physics engine

## Currently, Implemented
- Gravity
- Bouncing
- Elasticity
- Spawning more balls
- Collisions with other balls
- Momentum with other balls
- Orbiting (Orbits tend to drift outward thanks to uncertainties with my numerical method)

## To-do:
- Dynamics
- Friction
- Chains
- Cloth
